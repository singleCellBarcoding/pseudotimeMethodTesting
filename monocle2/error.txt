Might be problems with either Matrix or igraph package. Not necessary monocle.

From https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle-release/issues/44:
Q: So if my data only has a few genes (not feature genes), it wouldn't work?
A: no. it cannot robustly and accurately estimate a mean variance relationship with a few genes. For Monocle 2 trajectory inference, feature genes which is selected by either supervise or non-supervised approach (like dpFeature) are often around 1k or so.
